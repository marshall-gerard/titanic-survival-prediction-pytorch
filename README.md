# Titanic Survival PyTorch

Clean and understandable machine learning pipeline to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using PyTorch, with feature engineering and modular code design.

---

## Project Overview

This project predicts whether Titanic passengers survived or not based on features such as age, gender, class, fare, family size, and derived features. The model is built using PyTorch and trained with advanced feature engineering to achieve approximately **80% accuracy**.
